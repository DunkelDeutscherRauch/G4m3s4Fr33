/**
TODO - cool stuff for the future (maybe) -
 -> implement SteamAPI (not the easiest one -> see https://steamcommunity.com/dev?l=german)
 -> autoComplete by name (complex)
 -> keep position in recyclerView combined with handleOnBackPressed (complex)
 -> autoMigration for RoomDB (https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/migrating-db-versions?hl=de)
 -> maybe(!) custom Toast (nom nom nom)
 -> maybe(!) implement smartphone camera stroboscope-effect for even more disco :D
